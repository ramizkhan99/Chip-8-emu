# Chip-8-emu

This is a Chip 8 Emulator written in C++ and uses SFML for Graphics and Audio.<br>
The project is made using Visual Studio 2019 and is dependent on the `windows.h` header file. If the `Color()` function is removed and `ConsoleColor.h` is not included, the rest should work on UNIX based systems as well.<br>

The keymapping used is similar to the one found in Multigesture.net(Link in references)
